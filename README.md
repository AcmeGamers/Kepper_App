# Kepper App

## Introduction
Project powered with React.JS and taught by Dr. Angela Yu (a really kind, great, and a respectful teacher). This is one of those projects that I have made during my practice session when learning React in my past. Thanks to her, I have been able to learn so many technologies with proper concepts and I shall always remain grateful for such an awesome teacher who lead all of the fellow students to the bright side of the tecchnology. Thank you so much Dr. Angela Yu, you're really amazing! (From your student, Acme).

## Working
This applet allows you to create a todo-list, although I haven't added the functionality to save files in the local storage at the moment so after refreshing the page, all changes or tasks added will disappear, and I will update it in the near future with the availablity of time.
