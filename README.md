# Kepper_App
Project powered with React.JS and taught by Dr. Angela Yu (a really kind, great, and a respectful teacher). This is one of those projects that I have made during my practice session when learning React in my past. Thanks to her, I have been able to learn so many technologies with proper concepts and I shall always remain grateful for such an awesome teacher who lead all of the fellow students to the bright side of the tecchnology. Thank you so much Dr. Angela Yu, you're really amazing! (From your student, Acme).
